**Task 3: Student Management System**

**Student Class:** I created a Student class that represents individual students with attributes like name, roll number, grade, age, email, and mobile number. 
**StudentManagementSystem:** This class manages the collection of students using an ArrayList and allows users to add, search, display, and remove student records.
**Console-Based Interface:** The application offers an intuitive console-based user interface, making it easy to interact with the system. 
Users can simply follow the prompts to perform various operations.
**Data Persistence:** To ensure data persistence, I implemented methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file.
The student records are stored in a "students.txt" file, allowing easy access to the data. 
**Input Validation:** I included input validation to ensure that required fields are not left empty and that the student data is in the correct format.
This helps in maintaining data integrity and preventing any erroneous entries.

**Sample Data**
The system can load student data from a CSV file.
Below is a sample of the data in the CSV file format:
Vijay,23,A,21,vi56@gmail.com,7889454562

Hema,20,C,22,he23@gmail.com,4546464640
Ginny,67,H,33,ginny@gmail.com,5613216511

Each line in the CSV file represents a student with their respective name, roll number, grade, age, email, and mobile number. 
A file named **"students.txt"** is also attached in this same repository.

**How to Use** 
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile all three Java files using the Java compiler.
Run the ConsoleUIx class to start the Student Management System. 
The system will present a menu with various options to manage student information. 
Follow the on-screen instructions to add, remove, search, and display all students.

**Features**
Add new students to the system with input validation for name, roll number, grade, age, email, and mobile number. 
Remove students from the system based on their roll number. 
Search for students by their roll number and display their details if found. 
Display a list of all students currently in the system.

In this way, this program demonstrated how Java can be utilized to build practical applications that have real-world applications.
